            <h4>september 7, 2023</h4>

            <p>the human psyche continues to confuse me.</p>

            <p>by most metrics, i'm probably okay. i have plenty of friends. i'm working out now, diet is going well.
                i'm travelling soon. my family is supportive of me.</p>

            <p>even emotionally, which tends to be my biggest struggle on a day-to-day, i don't even feel distressed
                like i have in the past few days. i am arguably feeling ok - i'm not spiralling like usual.</p>

            <h2>... </h2>

            <p>yet at the same time... </p>

            <p>i don't want people to notice me. </p>

            <p>i don't want to exist.</p>

            <p>i want to be nothing,</p>

            <p>like i know i always have been. </p>

            <h2>...</h2>

            <p>how can i be in two states at the same time? </p>

            <p>i tend to think of my state as a linear scale, from "good" to "bad". but i'm neither. i'm both.</p>

            <p>i'm suffering, but i'm not suffering.</p>

            <p>i want to live. i also want to not be alive.</p>

            <p>
                sometimes they say there's different "voices" when it comes to internal thoughts - like, one who
                talks trash and one who comforts you. that isn't how it feels right now. it all just feels
                like me.
            </p>

            <p>
                i can't decide where i want to go. all i can do right now is keep throwing myself back into the water.
            </p>
