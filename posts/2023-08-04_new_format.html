            <h1>new website format</h1>
            <h4>august 4, 2023</h4>
            <p>i logged into here today, originally just to add bluesky to my links page, but then i had a "5 minute
                coding adventure" and decided to restructure this so i can add a new post whenever i'd like to.
            </p>

            <p>to be honest, i think i've reached a certain state of exhaustion and exasperation
                with the wider social internet and its structure.
            </p>

            <p>maybe it's worsened slightly by the social circles i'm a part of, but i hate having
                to perform a positive outward image of myself on social media.
            </p>

            <p>well - okay, maybe I don't
                NEED to do that. but i feel like i'm really dragging down the vibe if i clutter a twitter
                (or mastodon or bluesky) timeline with my ramblings. i feel like it's gonna lower the mood of
                someone who's looking at it. </p>

            <p>i also feel frustrated when i'm not able to adequately express myself given
                the format of the website. ironically, this whole post is something i wanted to post about elsewhere,
                but all the platforms that are popular with furries limit to ~300 chars.</p>

            <p>it's really hard to say if it's just me nostalgia bombing. but I really feel like we lost something
                with the development of the modern internet. i know it's easy to make corporations a scapegoat and
                complain about the way they've taken control of the internet, but... seriously! wtf happened?
            </p>

            <p>
                i miss having my own forum accounts, my own homepage, my own expression.
                i miss internet anonymity, and having an identity that can't easily be traced back in 0.1 seconds to my
                job. i miss browsing the internet and creating things literally 100% for fun, and not trying to turn it
                into something marketable or for future job opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>i need something, yknow?</p>

            <p>i figure, why not just go back to making a blog? people who are actually genuinely interested
                can pop in and see what i've written, and people who aren't really interested? that's genuinely
                fine.
            </p>

            <p>i guess there's way more freedom when you have your own homepage. like, if i want to suddenly switch to
                <span style="color:hotpink; font-family:'Comic Sans MS'">hot pink comic sans</span> or embed a picture
                of a hot dog <img style="width: 4em; height: 2em;" src="img/hotdog_tiny.gif" />mid sentence, nobody is
                really gonna stop me (or care) i guess. so yeah, suck it, zuckerberg. i posted a <strong>hot
                    dog</strong>. whatcha gonna do, SUE ME????????? </p>

            <p>no promises that i keep up with any of this tho. decent probability i just never end up updating.
            </p>

            <p>but that's also kind of also the point here. i don't want expectation.</p>

            <p> thx for stopping to say hello. very ðŸ˜Ž cool of u thanks</p>
