            <p>
                I love DJing. But I've also been feeling a bit stifled at times by my artistic medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like there's so much more to life than dancing and partying.
                Not that I dislike those things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The current ecosystem of the internet doesn't seem to provide space for reflection.
                There's little breathing room for art to express complex emotions. You have to fight the medium
                to try and get those messages out there.
